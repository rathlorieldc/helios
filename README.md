The Helios Retirement Destination Planner is a capstone project for course CMSC 495 at the University of Maryland Global Campus. The result is a web application that allows a user to search for a retirement destination and decade (2020, 2040, 2060, 2080) and returns climate change data and natural disasters data to help choose the best possible place for retirement. The climate projections are based on two scenarios: humans changing course to significantly lower emissions, or humans continuing the current course to increasingly higher emissions. Climate data for each location is based on county data, while natural disasters data is organized by state. We felt the most relevant climate variables for a comfortable retirement destination were average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, the number of days with extreme temperatures, average annual precipitation, and the total number of dry days. The application provides a retirement score on a scale of 1 to 10 that is an average of the combined scores for each climate variable, which are calculated using formulas that assess deviation from either an ideal value or the national average, depending on the variable.
